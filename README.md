# Corona-Research
This is a Data science and Machine Learning Project based on the information I've gathered about COVD-19. This project visualises the data and also I've trained a model which is able to predict the number of cases,recoveries and deaths after one week . I ended the project on 23rdmarch and uploading on 30th march.You can see yourself that the prediction followed the reports on that day.I used Prophet fron Facebook for this project and coded in google Colab
